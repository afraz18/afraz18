Hi Afraj!
This is your personalized README. To make it perfect, you just need to:
Replace [your-github-username] with your actual GitHub username in the two spots under "My GitHub Stats".
Replace [your-linkedin-url] with the full URL to your LinkedIn profile.
Create a banner image! A 1280x300px image works great. You can design one in Figma or Canva. I've put a placeholder for now.
To use this on your profile:
Create a new public repository with the exact same name as your GitHub username.
Add this README.md file to that repository. GitHub will automatically display it on your profile page!
